# Random Act of Flickr

[ashthunt.github.io/randomactofflickr](https://ashthunt.github.io/randomactofflickr)
RAoF is a simple web application that uses Flickr's REST consumable, JSON API to

  - Acquire a user's ID from their username
  - Use that data to grab a random photo from their public collection
  - Set a filtered version of that as the background!
